Humpback whales have a long, streamlined body with a distinct hump on their back, which is where their name comes from. They also have long pectoral fins, which can be up to one-third of their body length, and a large tail fin, known as the fluke. The fluke is often used for identification purposes, as it has unique patterns and markings that are specific to each individual whale. Additionally, humpback whales have a series of small bumps, called tubercles, on the leading edge of their pectoral fins. These tubercles are thought to enhance the whale's maneuverability and may also help with sensory perception. Overall, when looking at a photo of a humpback whale, the key visual features to focus on are its size, body shape, hump, pectoral fins, fluke, and any unique patterns or markings on the fluke.\",\n",

      "mouse  ->   :  When it comes to distinguishing a mouse in a photo, there are several useful visual features to consider. Firstly, the size of the mouse can be a distinguishing factor, as mice are generally small in comparison to other animals. Their body length typically ranges from 2.5 to 4 inches, excluding the tail. Secondly, the shape and structure of the mouse's body can be helpful in identification. Mice have a small, rounded head with prominent ears and a pointed snout. They also have a distinct body shape, with a slender and elongated torso. Additionally, the fur color and pattern can provide valuable visual clues. Mice generally have short fur, which can vary in color from light brown to gray to black. Some mice may also have patterns such as spots or stripes on their fur. Finally, the presence of certain features like whiskers and a long, thin tail can further aid in identifying a mouse in a photo. Whiskers are typically long and bristly and are used by mice for sensory purposes. The tail of a mouse is usually longer than its body, hairless, and thin. By considering these visual features, one can successfully distinguish a mouse in a photo.\n",

      "collie  ->   :  For distinguishing a collie in a photo, there are several useful visual features to consider. One of the most distinctive features of a collie is its long and flowing coat. Collies typically have a dense double coat that is either rough or smooth in texture. In a photo, this can be a key visual feature to look for, as it sets them apart from other breeds. The color of the coat can also be helpful in identifying a collie. They are commonly seen in sable and white, tricolor, or blue merle variations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another visual feature to consider is the shape and size of the collie's head and face. Collies have a distinct wedge-shaped head with a pronounced stop between their forehead and muzzle. Their eyes are typically almond-shaped and set apart, giving them an alert and intelligent expression. The ears are usually medium-sized and carried erect or semi-erect.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, the body proportions of a collie can be useful in distinguishing them in a photo. They have a well-balanced and athletic build, with a deep chest and a level topline. The tail is long and carried low, often with a slight upward curve at the end.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, by looking for these visual features such as the long, flowing coat, distinctive head shape, and well-proportioned body, one can easily identify a collie in a photo.\n",

      "walrus  ->   :  When it comes to distinguishing a walrus in a photo, there are several useful visual features to consider. Firstly, the most prominent feature of a walrus is its large size, with adult males weighing up to 1.5 tons. This can be observed by comparing the size of the walrus to its surroundings or other objects in the photo. \n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, walruses have unique physical characteristics, such as their long, prominent tusks. These tusks can grow up to three feet long in adult males and are used for various purposes, including defense, foraging, and hauling themselves out of the water. The presence and size of these tusks can be a clear indicator that the animal in the photo is a walrus.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, walruses have a distinct body shape, with a thick and blubbery appearance. Their bodies are rounded and have a wrinkled texture, which helps them to regulate their body temperature in cold Arctic waters. This can be observed in a photo by looking for these distinctive body proportions and texture.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, walruses have specific coloration that can help in identification. They typically have a brown or reddish-brown skin, which can appear mottled or spotted. Their skin is also often covered in scars or barnacles, which can further aid in distinguishing them in a photo.\n",
      "\n",
      "By considering these visual features such as size, tusks, body shape, and coloration, one can accurately identify a walrus in a photo.\n",

One key feature is their distinct facial mask, which typically consists of dark fur around their eyes, giving them a bandit-like appearance. Another important visual characteristic is their ringed tail, which is usually fluffy and has alternating light and dark bands. Raccoons also have a stocky build, with a robust body and short legs. Their fur is typically gray or brownish-gray, and they often have a bushy appearance. Additionally, raccoons have small, rounded ears and their front paws resemble hands, with long, dexterous fingers that they use for manipulating objects. These visual features can be helpful for identifying a raccoon in a photo and distinguishing it from other animals.\n",

Cows are typically large animals, with an average adult cow weighing several hundred kilograms. They have a distinct body shape, characterized by a broad and rounded torso, a long neck, and four legs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Coloration can also be a distinguishing feature, as cows usually have a combination of white, brown, or black patches on their bodies. This pattern can vary depending on the breed of the cow. Some cows have solid color coats, while others have distinct patterns such as spots or stripes.\n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of anatomical characteristics, cows have certain features that can aid in identification. These include their prominent ears, which are usually large and drooping down. Cows also have a distinctive snout or muzzle, with a wide nose and nostrils. Their eyes are usually large and expressive, set on the sides of their head.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, cows have udders, which are located on their underbelly and are used for milk production. Depending on the age and reproductive status of the cow, the udder may vary in size and shape. This can be a useful feature for distinguishing female cows from males.\n",

Firstly, the overall body shape of a dolphin is a key characteristic. They have a streamlined, torpedo-like body with a curved back and a long snout called a rostrum. This shape allows them to move swiftly through the water. \n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, dolphins have a unique coloration pattern that can help identify them. Most dolphins have a dark gray or bluish-gray back and a lighter underside, known as countershading. This coloration helps them blend in with the water, making them less visible to predators and prey.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another important visual feature is the dorsal fin. Dolphins have a prominent dorsal fin on their backs, which can vary in shape and size depending on the species. Some dorsal fins are tall and curved, while others are more triangular or slightly hooked. This fin can be used to distinguish between different species of dolphins.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, the presence of other physical characteristics like scars, markings, or unique patterns on their bodies can also be helpful in identifying individual dolphins. These markings can be used for research and conservation purposes, as they can help track and monitor specific individuals.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, when trying to distinguish a dolphin in a photo, it is important to consider the body shape, coloration pattern, dorsal fin characteristics, and any unique markings or features that may be present. By analyzing these visual features, it becomes easier to identify and differentiate dolphins from other marine animals.\n",
